They offered their condolences for the loss of our beloved dog.  The stone is thick, rounded on the ends, nothing sharp.  The letters are carved into the biscuit and darkened so you can read them.  It has a nice smooth finish.  The biscuit was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, so it was well padded in a box with more stuffing to keep it from moving in the box.

Later, a friend of mine carved a memorial out of wood and nailed it to the tree where Tonka died.  I have had several dogs since then and when each one passed I had a stone carved. Fast forward many years and I sold my house where Tonka’s memorial was fastened to the tree and I decided he needed a stone of his own.  After telling Rodney the story, he made a stunning memorial for Tonka and used a wood grain stone.

I ordered a 10x16x2\" customized black granite memorial stone to mark the area where my late husband's ashes will be scattered. I am over-the-top satisfied with the quality of the stone, engraving, delivery time and communications with this company.\n\nAlmost immediately after placing my online order, I exchanged a couple of emails with Rodney regarding my customization request. Within 24 hours, I had a proof for my review. Because I was not incorporating photo images for the stone, I was able to request deeper sandblasted letters/logos. \n\nRodney was easy to work with, provided suggestions and answered questions. His promise of a quality product and fast delivery was accurate. It exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend Melton Memorials!","order_id":2813764127},{"reviewer":"Ashley","date_reviewed":"03/28/2023","star_rating":5,"message":"Beautiful item, great quality!","order_id":2762871809},{"reviewer":"Abby","date_reviewed":"03/27/2023","star_rating":5,"message":"","order_id":2825511006},{"reviewer":"Mark","date_reviewed":"03/27/2023","star_rating":5,"message":"Great looking memorial stone for our pup.
