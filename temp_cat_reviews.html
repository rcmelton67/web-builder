I am so impressed with the quality that I'm considering redoing our cat's stone with this vendor. Our beloved pets deserve the best. I can't wait for the ten tons of snow to melt so that we can put this stone in a spot of honor in our memorial garden."</p>

I have purchased from them several times and communication is always wonderful, they ensure the design is what you want before making it and the end result is a memory for a lifetime. Highly recommend!"</p>
