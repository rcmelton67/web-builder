                <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; font-style:italic;">"Incredibly beautiful memorial. I could not have asked for better customer service or a better product. This is real genuine river rock. My soul dog loved the river and was a huge dork who would bring back random rocks from the water and stack them on the bank. I knew this was the perfect memorial for her. I sit next to it and talk to her often. I cannot thank you enough for such an incredible piece to always remember her. You’ll never know how much this means to me and Callie."</p>

                        a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals or wire brushes that could damage the lithichrome paint.
