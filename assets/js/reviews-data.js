They offered their condolences for the loss of our beloved dog.  The stone is thick, rounded on the ends, nothing sharp.  The letters are carved into the biscuit and darkened so you can read them.  It has a nice smooth finish.  The biscuit was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, so it was well padded in a box with more stuffing to keep it from moving in the box.

Later, a friend of mine carved a memorial out of wood and nailed it to the tree where Tonka died.  I have had several dogs since then and when each one passed I had a stone carved. Fast forward many years and I sold my house where Tonka’s memorial was fastened to the tree and I decided he needed a stone of his own.  After telling Rodney the story, he made a stunning memorial for Tonka and used a wood grain stone.

The original stone arrived a couple days before Christmas, (but the vendor wasn't taking chances.)  I cannot thank Mr. Melton enough for his excellent customer service.

Our Zelda passed away suddenly leaving us very sad. We were in shock. I decided to look for a quality head stone. I was very satisfied with this Etsy company. The head stone met my expectations and it was just like I designed it. I was happy with the purchase. This head stone graces our flower garden. It is nice to see Zelda among all of my flowers in the garden. Thank you for a great quality head stone.","order_id":2927176372},{"reviewer":"christinawasson","date_reviewed":"09/03/2023","star_rating":5,"message":"The grave marker turned out beautiful, and the owners were easy to work with!","order_id":2974659765},{"reviewer":"Betsy","date_reviewed":"09/03/2023","star_rating":5,"message":"Our memory stone was just what we were wanting.

I can’t say enough good things about these stones or the couple who create them. \n\nEach stone is unique and will complement your garden. (Some of the “stones” on Etsy are really resin molded blobs.) I was afraid they would be too small, but they’re just right.\n\nThe price is great, too, and since we were ordering a bunch, that was a consideration.\n\nThey provided me with proofs, which I approved. It turns out that I had made a mistake on my end, but they still offered to replace it (I paid for a new one, since it was my error, but it was still a thoughtful gesture.)\n\nBuy these for your beloved pet. They’re perfect.","order_id":2526027826},{"reviewer":"Lana","date_reviewed":"07/16/2022","star_rating":5,"message":"I am so impressed with the quality of my stone that I had made in remembrance of my cat.
