He loved biscuits so this was absolutely perfect. We cut some flowers from our yard and placed them around the stone. Everyone got to say something about Buddy. On ordering I had a question and the shop owner called me on the phone. They offered their condolences for the loss of our beloved dog. The stone is thick, rounded on the ends, nothing sharp. The letters are carved into the biscuit and darkened so you can read them. It has a nice smooth finish. The biscuit was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap, so it was well padded in a box with more stuffing to keep it from moving in the box. Again, I would like to say how happy I am with this item. Thank you Meltons!"

We settled in under a tree in the back yard to say goodbye. Later, a friend of mine carved a memorial out of wood and nailed it to the tree where Tonka died. I have had several dogs since then and when each one passed I had a stone carved. Fast forward many years and I sold my house where Tonka’s memorial was fastened to the tree and I decided he needed a stone of his own. After telling Rodney the story, he made a stunning memorial for Tonka and used a wood grain stone. I couldn’t be more pleased that Tonka now has his rightful place alongside all of my dogs who have crossed the bridge. Thank you, Rodney."

The quality of the memorial is exceptional—it's a fitting tribute to my brother, and the craftsmanship is beyond impressive. They treated this as a deeply personal project and it’s clear that they truly care about their customers. I’m so grateful for their dedication and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for thoughtful, high-quality memorials."

We had some shipping concerns causing me fear of not receiving timely for Christmas. I contacted the vendor to advise and he followed up immediately. Please note this was a shipper's issue and not the vendor. To ensure arrival by Christmas, he cut another stone, shipped immediately, no questions asked. He was very understanding and refused my offer to cover some of the additional costs. The original stone arrived a couple days before Christmas, (but the vendor wasn't taking chances.) I cannot thank Mr. Melton enough for his excellent customer service. You seldom find someone who will go out of his way to make things right, even though he wasn't necessarily at fault. I highly recommend this vendor"

So if you order other times of the year, I assume it would be faster. My only complaint is the seller forgot the gift message to the recipient so she had no idea who sent it to her. This was my second purchase from this seller with this same item (different recipient) and the message was included with my first purchase so not sure what occurred there. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase."

Given that we placed the order from a place of mourning after losing our dog of twelve years, the process going seamlessly meant the absolute world to my family; one less thing to stress over on our end, and I believe Autumn received the proper quality for her worth in our lives. The stone is absolutely beautiful, the material and engraving are amazing, and it's exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much."

She found the perfect pendant and worked with me on the correct color and chain length. She ordered it so it was ready when I was prepared to send out the ashes. The original plan we discussed wasn’t going to work, so we quickly came up with an alternative. Shockingly, my necklace was finished that night and shipped out the next day. It arrived about two days earlier than expected. Kayla sent the absolute sweetest note, which brought tears to my eyes. The pendant is everything and more than I could have ever wished for. It is absolutely stunning. Excellent customer service, super fast shipping, and wonderful work. This genuinely exceeded my expectation"

She was able to make 2 pendants with the ashes I sent to her and she was SO kind and accommodating, communicating often throughout her process! I can’t wait to wear these and have a piece of Jane with me all the time. Thank you Kayla!"

I asked if they had any granite that was white & gray since Boomer was a silver shaded Persian (more white in his old age!). Kayla was so sweet and accommodating - she found they had some marble and sent me a pic. It was perfect and reminded me of his beautiful fur. We will definitely be using Melton Memorials for future needs and to replace some of the crumbling resin “stones” we’ve gotten and the faded, peeling painted rocks I’ve made for all our many furbabies we’ve loved and lost."

The memorial stone arrived just as pictured, and we love it so much. We can finally lay our sister-kitties' ashes together and have a place in the backyard for my daughter to go to when she wants to spend time with them. Thank you so much!"

I love the moon and after sadly losing my dog in October I knew I wanted a memorial necklace of his ashes and fur to carry near my heart everyday! The owner of the shop was amazing with answering all my questions and helping me create a memorial piece I would love. They went back and forth with me about ideas and included everything I wanted. I can’t say enough about the shop and the care I can tell they put into every piece. Highly recommend them to everyone!!"

Our necklaces are absolutely stunning beautiful pieces that we will each be proud to wear with warm hearts after the loss of our faithful companion, Cooper. This seller is so thoughtful and went way above and beyond. From the moment I placed the order, I had many questions (probably to the point of annoyance) but this seller was very patient and pleasant. In addition, they contacted me a couple of times to ensure that they got everything perfect. They provided the order very quickly and included something extra, just because. The seller truly cares about their customers and puts their heart into their products! We’re so touched knowing that our pets ashes were handled with care and love. Happy tears from this family!"

Didn’t need to make any changes it looked great as it was. It arrived quickly and was packaged very well. The stone is heavy, which is good, and the color is beautiful. The cool thing about it is that the width edges have a rough look and feel, which shows the stone properties. This stone is perfect for honoring our fur-kid. It’s hard to make a purchase like this but if you need to, I highly recommend this shop! Plus, they have a FB site for grief support"

    "text": "After a bad experience with a pet stone order from a different Etsy seller, I found this shop. MM exceeded my expectations. Communication was prompt, and I received a proof before the stone was created. It turned out so beautifully. I even cried as soon as I unwrapped it. All the details were captured, and I love the natural color variation in the granite. It's the perfect memorial stone for my sweet little boy. Well crafted and fast shipping. I will use this shop for future orders."

I ordered a 10x16x2\" customized black granite memorial stone to mark the area where my late husband's ashes will be scattered. I am over-the-top satisfied with the quality of the stone, engraving, delivery time and communications with this company. Almost immediately after placing my online order, I exchanged a couple of emails with Rodney regarding my customization request. Within 24 hours, I had a proof for my review. Because I was not incorporating photo images for the stone, I was able to request deeper sandblasted letters/logos. Rodney was easy to work with, provided suggestions and answered questions. His promise of a quality product and fast delivery was accurate. It exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend Melton Memorials!"

I ordered 5 for each of my cats, including the two that had passed away and the three I still have. Since there is no date on them, you can order for all of your pets at any time. The stones are natural enough to put outside but also nice enough to display inside. Additionally they are larger than I thought. I love them with the white lettering! Thank you"

I showed my husband several options on Etsy, and he liked this one best. The seller was very kind and so great to work with, sending sketches for me to approve our favorite. My husband was deeply touched. He's planning to bury Hero's ashes in his favorite spot at the top of the hill in our front yard and put the head stone there. We could not ask for a better memorial for my husband's Hero."

When you're grieving it's hard to deal with the loss of a pet but Rodney made the experience effortless. I was having a hard time with the saying that I wanted and Rodney provided the perfect one he also allows you to pick the look of your granite memorial stone by sending you pictures. This is the third one I purchased since I lost two of my furbabies within 2 months. I hope I don't have to do this again anytime soon but if I do I wouldn't go anywhere else. This is a place you want to go to for your Memorial. You won't be disappointed."

Kayla was so incredibly kind and flexible and sent me so many proofs with even minor adjustments because I just couldn’t decide what looked best through my grief. She was even so sweet as to flip the figures around for me so I could see every option available to me. I was so happy with the final product. Thank you so much, Kayla, for being so kind during such a hard time. And, of course, for delivering such beautiful and meaningful work. I love it."

I requested bigger paw prints initially but due to delay getting the proof I didn’t want to push to get them bigger and cause anymore delays. I am overall really happy just would have preferred a quicker proof and the ability to feel like I had time to request bigger paws (not sure if even possible). Again, looks great just would recommend to those purchasing to reach out asap if you don’t get the proof."

I am using them to create a memorial garden. Rodney was supportive, attentive, and is obviously a masterful artist. You can tell his heart is invested in his work. I’m forever grateful he became a part of our story, while he and his work helped To soothe my Broken heart. God bless you for helping so many who grieve the loss of our fur babies. Regina"

I can’t tell you what it means to me to be able to give these beautiful headstones to my loved ones missing their fur babies. Although this order was for a dog that was a family dog she grew up with, it was received with so much joy to have something to place on his gravesite. Something so special to remember him by. I also unfortunately need to order another one very soon, and I am so thankful for your beautiful and loving work. Thank you for being in business and all of your help choosing and making them perfect."

Each stone is unique and will complement your garden. (Some of the “stones” on Etsy are really resin molded blobs.) I was afraid they would be too small, but they’re just right. The price is great, too, and since we were ordering a bunch, that was a consideration. They provided me with proofs, which I approved. It turns out that I had made a mistake on my end, but they still offered to replace it (I paid for a new one, since it was my error, but it was still a thoughtful gesture.)

It is made so beautifully and respectfully, and I love that the creator takes the time to reach out and send a draft of the product so you know how it will look. I gotta say though, the actual stone looks more beautiful than any draft, and this is the perfect way to remember my dear kitty that passed recently. Thank you so much."

This one being cast concrete makes it hefty and like it belongs in a garden or in a yard. It feels like it belongs. I highly recommend not only a material like this (as opposed to plastic/resin) but also the one sold here. They made sure our stone looked exactly how we wanted and shipped it quickly. It’s something our family will hold onto for the rest of our lives."
